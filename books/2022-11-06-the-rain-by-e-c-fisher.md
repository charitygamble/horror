<p class="review__description">A storm is raging. That’s merely one of Detective Daniel Nash’s troubles. Charlie Hamilton, the resident drunk and proprietor of Camp High Tide has mysteriously perished. After combing through old files, he learns that thirty years ago a young boy went missing. His body never discovered. He requests an interview with the five campers who were interrogated during that time.</p>

<p>The bodies of the suspects start piling up. Each death is similar and equally horrifying. Detective Nash must locate the suspects before the culprit has a chance to finish them off.</p>

> I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

I’ll admit, this book seems awfully familiar. Probably because the beginning seems like a slightly revamped version of **Friday the 13th**. And honestly, that’s what this book is. It’s a revamped version of **Friday the 13th**, where the real culprits are the ones who get theirs instead of innocent kids who happened to be reopening the camp or near the lake.

Kids will be kids and bullies abound even at summer camp. Poor Timmy Waters suffers the same fate as Jason Voorhees, only Timmy dies as the result of a prank, not lifeguards and counselors not paying attention. But Timmy isn’t about to let his bullies get away with killing him. The tale is interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn’t be opposed to reading more of E. C. Fisher’s books if they’re all like **The Rain**.

Trust me, you won’t be disappointed with this book at all, if you like horror.
