<p class="review__description">Discover a terrifying world in the woods in this collection of five hauntingly beautiful graphic stories that includes the online webcomic sensation “His Face All Red,” in print for the first time.</p>

<p>Journey through the woods in this sinister, compellingly spooky collection that features four brand-new stories and one phenomenally popular tale in print for the first time. These are fairy tales gone seriously wrong, where you can travel to “Our Neighbor’s House”—though coming back might be a problem. Or find yourself a young bride in a house that holds a terrible secret in “A Lady’s Hands Are Cold.” You might try to figure out what is haunting “My Friend Janna,” or discover that your brother’s fiancée may not be what she seems in “The Nesting Place.” And of course you must revisit the horror of “His Face All Red,” the breakout webcomic hit that has been gorgeously translated to the printed page.</p>

<p>Already revered for her work online, award-winning comic creator Emily Carroll’s stunning visual style and impeccable pacing is on grand display in this entrancing anthology, her print debut.</p>

I heard about *Through the Woods* on a social network that was touting horror books and I decided to give it a shot. I have to say, I wasn’t disappointed.

I didn’t know anything about the book before I started, just that it was called *Through the Woods*. I was surprised to find it in comic style as that hadn’t been part of the book’s description on the post I found it on. However, the fact that it was in comic style didn’t detract from it at all. In fact, it made it very easy to read and very quick to read. I blew through book in no time at all.

The stories presented are creepy and well presented, but not gory or gross. The artwork is beautiful. This book was so hard to stop reading that I got annoyed when someone interrupted me to talk. I would love to see another book from Emily Carroll like this because this one was just absolutely perfect.
