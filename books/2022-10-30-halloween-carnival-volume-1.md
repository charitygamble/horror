<p class="review__description">Robert McCammon, Kevin Lucia, John R. Little, Lisa Morton, and Mark Allan Gunnells put the horror back in Halloween with a quintet of devilishly delightful tales, curated by acclaimed author and editor Brian James Freeman.</p>

<p><b>STRANGE CANDY by Robert McCammon</b> Chocolate bars and sour suckers are trick-or-treat staples, but beware the odd sweet at the bottom of your bag. You never know who it’s from—or what it might do to you.</p>

<p><b>THE RAGE OF ACHILLES by Kevin Lucia</b> Father Ward should have heeded the warnings about hearing confession on All Hallow’s Eve. Because a man is about to tell him a secret more haunting than any he has heard before. </p>

<p><b>DEMON AIR by John R. Little</b> Fear of flying is not uncommon. But on this transpacific airline, the real danger isn’t the flight itself. It’s whoever—or whatever—is up in the air with you.</p>

<p><b>LA HACIENDA DE LOS MUERTOS by Lisa Morton</b> Trick McGrew, former cowboy star of the silver screen, has never believed in tall tales. But down in Mexico, the land of La Llorona, he’s about to find out just how real urban legends can be.</p>

<p><b>#MAKEHALLOWEENSCARYAGAIN by Mark Allan Gunnells</b> Some people will go to any lengths to rack up retweets, likes, and follows on social media, no matter who they end up hurting . . . or even killing.</p>

> I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

Halloween is my favorite holiday. This is something that anyone who knows me will tell you. I am a Halloween fanatic. So when given the chance to review books with stories based on Halloween and Halloween traditions – and those books are horror novels, you can bet I jumped at that chance. *Halloween Carnival Volume 1* is the first of five volumes of Halloween short stories, each in the horror category.

Volume 1 starts off with a story that isn’t so much scary as weird and sad. It’s a great story and one that I’ve read twice now – in fact I’ve read the entire book twice now – and I have to say that it’s just as weird and sad each time. The book ends with a story that I think belongs more in a mystery & thriller compilation than a horror/Halloween compilation. Again, it’s great story and I’ve read it twice, but I just don’t think it fits so well with the idea of a Halloween/horror story.

The stories are all well written and I think they’d make a great addition to anyone’s Halloween reading list. It takes around 3 hours to finish the book if you read at an average to above average speed, so you could technically get through more than one of these volumes in a day.

I gave this one 4 stars because the stories have a good Halloween creepy vibe to them and they work well for those wanting a quick Halloween-themed read.
