<p class="review__description">Glen Hirshberg, Lee Thomas, Holly Newstein, Del James, and Al Sarrantonio bring the ghouls of the most haunted night of the year to life in a chilling collection of stories curated by master of horror Brian James Freeman. </p>
<p><b>MR. DARK’S CARNIVAL by Glen Hirshberg</b> Halloween is more than just a holiday in Clarkson, Montana; it’s a tradition passed down through generations. Only this year, the ghosts of the past may just be a little closer than usual.</p>
<p><b>THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF MY SISTER by Lee Thomas</b> When David was young, he believed in magic. In fact, he wanted to become a magician himself. But meddling in the forces of the mind has consequences beyond what an eleven-year-old can see. </p>
<p><b>MISCHIEF NIGHT by Holly Newstein</b> Cabbage Night, Goose Night, Devil’s Night—they’re all the same. Before the treats come the tricks. It’s all in good fun . . . until someone gets hurt.</p>
<p><b>THE GHOST MAKER by Del James</b> When people need to disappear, I make them vanish. The catch? I’ve always got to be on guard—because that knock at the door may not just be a little monster looking for candy.</p>
<p><b>THE PUMPKIN BOY by Al Sarrantonio </b> When boys start going missing, Detective Len Schneider is determined to make it right. But his partner knows that there are worse things out there than a dead kid.</p>

<p>While I loved <strong>Halloween Carnival Volume One</strong>, I wasn’t quite as impressed with <strong>Halloween Carnival Volume Two</strong>.</p>
<p>To my idea, the best story in this batch of five stories was <strong>Mr. Dark’s Carnival</strong> by Glen Hirshberg. It added a twist at the end that I honestly didn’t see coming. I’m not sure why, but I didn’t see it coming. It was awesome, creepy, and just like when I watched <strong>The Sixth Sense</strong>, there were clues that I didn’t realize pointed to the ending.</p>
<p><strong>The Facts in the Case of My Sister</strong> by Lee Thomas wasn’t too bad either. I kind of figured what was going on, but there were a couple of subtle things that startled me that had nothing to do with the actual story line, but were just awesome things to see in the story. While this story was predictable, it was very good.</p>
<p><strong>Mischief Night</strong> by Holly Newstein wasn’t even memorable enough for me to remember what the story was about. I literally finished the book less than 24 hours ago and have no clue what that story was about.</p>
<p><strong>The Ghost Maker</strong> by Del James wasn’t scary or creepy. It didn’t even fit as horror, sci fi, or fantasy. There was nothing horror about it. It was so straight forward that I just didn’t see the point in it being there.</p>
<p><strong>The Pumpkin Boy</strong> by Al Sarrantonio was just plain weird. I have no idea what the author was going for, but I’m assuming weird wasn’t it. It had a plot twist that just didn’t make a lick of sense because you didn’t know enough about the backstory. I think it could have been a better story if the backstory behind it had been better fleshed out.</p>
<p>All in all, the only reason this collection didn’t get 2 stars was because of Mr. Dark’s Carnival – that was a great story and I’d love to see more like that in Volumes 3-5.</p>

<p class="review__description">A storm is raging. That’s merely one of Detective Daniel Nash’s troubles. Charlie Hamilton, the resident drunk and proprietor of Camp High Tide has mysteriously perished. After combing through old files, he learns that thirty years ago a young boy went missing. His body never discovered. He requests an interview with the five campers who were interrogated during that time.</p>
<p>The bodies of the suspects start piling up. Each death is similar and equally horrifying. Detective Nash must locate the suspects before the culprit has a chance to finish them off.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, this book seems awfully familiar. Probably because the beginning seems like a slightly revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>. And honestly, that’s what this book is. It’s a revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, where the real culprits are the ones who get theirs instead of innocent kids who happened to be reopening the camp or near the lake.</p>
<p>Kids will be kids and bullies abound even at summer camp. Poor Timmy Waters suffers the same fate as Jason Voorhees, only Timmy dies as the result of a prank, not lifeguards and counselors not paying attention. But Timmy isn’t about to let his bullies get away with killing him. The tale is interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn’t be opposed to reading more of E. C. Fisher’s books if they’re all like <strong>The Rain</strong>.</p>
<p>Trust me, you won’t be disappointed with this book at all, if you like horror.</p>

<p class="review__description">Horror Thriller Novels</p>
<p>This is a horror story of a man who began to see hallucinations, had so many battles to fight with, killing a king in his sleep, and a lady who was kidnapped by a man, who she doesn't know her plans, but she's not sure if she would make it out alive. If you are considering the shortest and most intriguing horror story, you found yourself one. This is the best story for you .with the right suspense.</p>

<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from BookSprout to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what the author was actually going for, because if he was truly going for a psychological thriller, he missed the mark. There was nothing thrilling or scary about this book. At all. There might have been some psychological things going on, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p><em>DE’FEAR</em> is a collection of two extremely short stories meant to set you on edge. While the second one did leave off on a fairly interesting cliffhanger, I have to say that neither story was particularly grabbing. The book was all of 24 pages on my iPhone’s iBooks, and the book hasn’t even been put on Goodreads as of this post being written.</p>
<p>I found the writing style to be juvenile, which I suppose is to be expected as it appears this is M. J. Reese’s first book and he is self-publishing. This means he is also self-editing which indicates that while he is trying, and I commend him for that, I believe he could benefit from some professional assistance with his writing.</p>
<p>The stories have potential, but sadly they read like the hurriedly jotted down ideas of a writer’s mind that whirls far too fast to keep up with. I believe if M. J. Reese were to sit down and work on just one of those ideas and make it an actual full length novel, he might be able to get his career going. As it is now, I am sad to say that a writer who just needs some guidance may never end up seeing the light of day.</p>
