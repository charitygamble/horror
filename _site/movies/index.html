<p class="review__description">The nightmare isn’t over as unstoppable killer Michael Myers escapes from Laurie Strode’s trap to continue his ritual bloodbath. Injured and taken to the hospital, Laurie fights through the pain as she inspires residents of Haddonfield, Ill., to rise up against Myers. Taking matters into their own hands, the Strode women and other survivors form a vigilante mob to hunt down Michael and end his reign of terror once and for all.</p>

<p>If you know me, you know that I love the Halloween series. Not the biggest fan of <em>Halloween III: Season of the Witch</em>, but now that I know the reasoning behind why it doesn't fit with the rest of the series, I'm not going to go off on a tangent regarding the movie.</p>
<p>N﻿ow in case you aren't aware, with these last three movies, <em>Halloween (2018)</em>, <em>Halloween Kills</em>, and <em>Halloween Ends</em>, John Carpenter and David Gordon Green retconned <em>Halloween 4 - Resurrection</em>. In this case, they decided that those events never actually happened. Some sources say that <em>Halloween 2</em> was also part of the retconning, which at first I'd doubted, but thinking back on a few scenes in <em>Halloween Kills</em>, I'm inclined to think it's true.</p>
<p>S﻿o when we enter <em>Halloween Kills</em>, we're entering more or less where <em>Halloween (2018)</em> left off. The movie is pretty good, not the best movie ever and certainly not the best movie in the Halloween series (that distinction goes to <em>Halloween Ends</em>, review to come). But there are some pretty darned good scenes in the movie, including a possible explanation for why Michael was alive to come back 40 years after he'd murdered Laurie's friends and almost killed her. I say possible because this *is* Michael Myers we're talking about.</p>
<p>Possible spoiler alert, although I'm pretty sure this has been mentioned in other Halloween movies, but at one point you'll hear Laurie say that Michael is nearly impossible to kill/get rid of. Which we've seen from other movies. But if the series was retconned clear back to the end of <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, how would she know? If <em>Halloween 2</em>'s events never happened, how would she know? I mean, when Loomis shot Michael in <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, we can always make the argument that he missed anything vital, which is how <em>Halloween 2</em> happened. But if none of the others happened, how would she know that he was hard to kill?</p>
<p>T﻿his movie showcases exactly how difficult Michael is to kill, based on one scene alone. All I can say is, he should have been at very least paralyzed, if not flat out dead.</p>
<p>Despite these plot holes and issues, this was a really good movie. Not fantastic, but really good. It gave a good bit of social commentary on how we can end up with a mob mentality and not care what is actually going on when we collectively decide something. The court of public opinion and all. Even when being told they're wrong, the mob will always stay their course.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, this movie was a great addition to the series - even if it does take part in retconning a bunch of the movies. I recommend you give this one a watch - and definitely watch it before you watch <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p>

<p class="review__description">IT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!</p>
<p>A frustrated Boston detective searches for the maniac responsible for mutilating a number of university coeds.</p></p>
</div>
<p>W﻿hen I looked into watching this one, the poster on Shudder said &quot;You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre&quot;. I thought that was kind of funny so I decided to give it a look. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the chainsaw massacre. It wasn't even really a massacre.</p>
<p>I﻿t kind of floors me that this movie was released after the original <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, yet it's so much different . It was almost as if the writers and the director were trying to cash in on the idea of <em>TCM</em>, but without having to go to all the trouble to make it actually be like <em>TCM</em>. Then they turn around and try to compare it to the classic.</p>
<p>T﻿he movie isn't terrible. It is a bit hokey, but we all know that most horror movies from that era aren't really scary and have terrible special effects - although they were &quot;cutting edge&quot; at the time. I will say that this one could have done a better job of keeping you guessing. You pretty much can guess who is doing all the killing once you you hear what one of the victims says to him.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, it isn't a bad movie and I'd watch it again.</p>

<p class="review__description">CAN A MOVIE GO TOO FAR?</p>
<p>A New York University professor returns from a rescue mission to the Amazon rainforest with the footage shot by a lost team of documentarians who were making a film about the area’s local cannibal tribes.</p></p>
</div>
<blockquote>Spoiler Alert - This review contains a few spoilers for the movie, although nothing that really spoils the plot. Read at your own risk.</blockquote>
<p>I﻿'m going to come right out and say, I hated this movie. I gave it two stars, which was being generous. It should probably have been a one star movie.</p>
<p>W﻿hen I watched <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i>, I thought &quot;how bad can it be&quot;? Bad. As in, really bad. As in, how did this movie ever even get made? Now when it comes to horror films, I'm used to blood, guts, gore, torture, and even cannibalism. This isn't the first movie I've seen where cannibalism plays a part in the film. So the gore, torture, and cannibalism didn't really bother me. What did?</p>
<p>G﻿raphic depictions of killing animals. I'm sorry, there's no reason to show in graphic detail the killing of an animal. I don't care if it is for food purposes or to show what kind of sick monster the killer is. Leave the animals out of it. I did not need to see the graphic murder of a muskrat or a giant turtle. I expect graphic depictions of killing people, after all that's half of what most horror films are about. But when you bring graphic depictions of animal killings into it, I draw the line.</p>
<p>I﻿ finished the movie simply because I wasn't about to leave it halfway through the movie, but I definitely won't be watching this one again. I have zero desire to ever see that kind of unnecessary animal cruelty ever again.</p>
