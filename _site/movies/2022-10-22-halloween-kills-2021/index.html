<p class="review__description">The nightmare isn’t over as unstoppable killer Michael Myers escapes from Laurie Strode’s trap to continue his ritual bloodbath. Injured and taken to the hospital, Laurie fights through the pain as she inspires residents of Haddonfield, Ill., to rise up against Myers. Taking matters into their own hands, the Strode women and other survivors form a vigilante mob to hunt down Michael and end his reign of terror once and for all.</p>

<p>If you know me, you know that I love the Halloween series. Not the biggest fan of <em>Halloween III: Season of the Witch</em>, but now that I know the reasoning behind why it doesn't fit with the rest of the series, I'm not going to go off on a tangent regarding the movie.</p>
<p>N﻿ow in case you aren't aware, with these last three movies, <em>Halloween (2018)</em>, <em>Halloween Kills</em>, and <em>Halloween Ends</em>, John Carpenter and David Gordon Green retconned <em>Halloween 4 - Resurrection</em>. In this case, they decided that those events never actually happened. Some sources say that <em>Halloween 2</em> was also part of the retconning, which at first I'd doubted, but thinking back on a few scenes in <em>Halloween Kills</em>, I'm inclined to think it's true.</p>
<p>S﻿o when we enter <em>Halloween Kills</em>, we're entering more or less where <em>Halloween (2018)</em> left off. The movie is pretty good, not the best movie ever and certainly not the best movie in the Halloween series (that distinction goes to <em>Halloween Ends</em>, review to come). But there are some pretty darned good scenes in the movie, including a possible explanation for why Michael was alive to come back 40 years after he'd murdered Laurie's friends and almost killed her. I say possible because this *is* Michael Myers we're talking about.</p>
<p>Possible spoiler alert, although I'm pretty sure this has been mentioned in other Halloween movies, but at one point you'll hear Laurie say that Michael is nearly impossible to kill/get rid of. Which we've seen from other movies. But if the series was retconned clear back to the end of <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, how would she know? If <em>Halloween 2</em>'s events never happened, how would she know? I mean, when Loomis shot Michael in <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, we can always make the argument that he missed anything vital, which is how <em>Halloween 2</em> happened. But if none of the others happened, how would she know that he was hard to kill?</p>
<p>T﻿his movie showcases exactly how difficult Michael is to kill, based on one scene alone. All I can say is, he should have been at very least paralyzed, if not flat out dead.</p>
<p>Despite these plot holes and issues, this was a really good movie. Not fantastic, but really good. It gave a good bit of social commentary on how we can end up with a mob mentality and not care what is actually going on when we collectively decide something. The court of public opinion and all. Even when being told they're wrong, the mob will always stay their course.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, this movie was a great addition to the series - even if it does take part in retconning a bunch of the movies. I recommend you give this one a watch - and definitely watch it before you watch <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p>
