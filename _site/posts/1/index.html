<p>Release Year: 1980</p>
<p>Director: Ruggero Deodato</p>
<p>CAN A MOVIE GO TOO FAR?</p>
<p>A New York University professor returns from a rescue mission to the Amazon rainforest with the footage shot by a lost team of documentarians who were making a film about the area's local cannibal tribes.</p>
<p>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</p>
</div>
<p>Spoiler Alert - This review contains a few spoilers for the movie, although nothing that really spoils the plot. Read at your own risk.</p>
<p>I﻿'m going to come right out and say, I hated this movie. I gave it two stars, which was being generous. It should probably have been a one star movie.</p>
<p>W﻿hen I watched <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i>, I thought &quot;how bad can it be&quot;? Bad. As in, really bad. As in, how did this movie ever even get made? Now when it comes to horror films, I'm used to blood, guts, gore, torture, and even cannibalism. This isn't the first movie I've seen where cannibalism plays a part in the film. So the gore, torture, and cannibalism didn't really bother me. What did?</p>
<p>G﻿raphic depictions of killing animals. I'm sorry, there's no reason to show in graphic detail the killing of an animal. I don't care if it is for food purposes or to show what kind of sick monster the killer is. Leave the animals out of it. I did not need to see the graphic murder of a muskrat or a giant turtle. I expect graphic depictions of killing people, after all that's half of what most horror films are about. But when you bring graphic depictions of animal killings into it, I draw the line.</p>
<p>I﻿ finished the movie simply because I wasn't about to leave it halfway through the movie, but I definitely won't be watching this one again. I have zero desire to ever see that kind of unnecessary animal cruelty ever again.</p>

    <span class="film__stuff">Release Year: 1981<br>
    Director: Lucio Fulci<br>
    <p>BEYOND DEATH… BEYOND EVIL… BEYOND THE DREADED GATES OF HELL.</p>
    <p>A young woman inherits an old hotel in Louisiana where, following a series of supernatural “accidents”, she learns that the building was built over one of the entrances to Hell.</p>
    Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</span>
</div>
<p>When I watched <i>The Beyond</i> on Shudder, I knew it was going to be a bit on the &quot;hokey&quot; side of things. After all, the movie was released in 1981. Special effects weren't as good back then, so I wasn't expecting to see gore on today's scale.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that censors in 1983 basically cut the film to almost nothing and that it took nearly 20 years and help from Quentin Tarantino to get the uncut version released in the US. Apparently today's standards of fright and gore would be far too much for 1983's sensibilities, as I'll be honest, the gore wasn't that bad at all and I didn't see too much in the way of &quot;scary&quot; things. Then again, I don't scare easily when it comes to movies and books.</p>
<p>T﻿he plot is interesting enough although I wouldn't say it is the most interesting movie I've ever watched. It kept me interested and entertained for the roughly hour-and-a-half that the movie ran for, which is all I asked for in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>I﻿ gave the movie three stars, which means I'd watch it again, although it wouldn't be my first choice.</p>

  <span> class="when__posted">Posted on <span class="why__me">10-11-22</span> - by Charli</span>
  <article class="the__post"><p>Welcome to The Horror Revue - a blog where I review horror books, movies, and TV shows. I've always been a fan of horror movies, books, and TV shows. I remember watching &quot;Tales from the Dark Side&quot; late at night on Saturday nights with my sister and her friend. To me, they weren't particularly scary but they could be unsettling. Another show we liked to watch was Friday the 13th - the series. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I was watching horror flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween with my friends. All through my teen years, my mom would buy me horror novels while she bought herself romance novels at our local used bookstore. So my love of horror has been with me for a long time.</p>
<p>S﻿o now that you know a little background... welcome to the circus!</p>
