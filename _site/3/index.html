<p class="review__description">Robert McCammon, Kevin Lucia, John R. Little, Lisa Morton, and Mark Allan Gunnells put the horror back in Halloween with a quintet of devilishly delightful tales, curated by acclaimed author and editor Brian James Freeman.</p>
<p><b>STRANGE CANDY by Robert McCammon</b> Chocolate bars and sour suckers are trick-or-treat staples, but beware the odd sweet at the bottom of your bag. You never know who it’s from—or what it might do to you.</p>
<p><b>THE RAGE OF ACHILLES by Kevin Lucia</b> Father Ward should have heeded the warnings about hearing confession on All Hallow’s Eve. Because a man is about to tell him a secret more haunting than any he has heard before. </p>
<p><b>DEMON AIR by John R. Little</b> Fear of flying is not uncommon. But on this transpacific airline, the real danger isn’t the flight itself. It’s whoever—or whatever—is up in the air with you.</p>
<p><b>LA HACIENDA DE LOS MUERTOS by Lisa Morton</b> Trick McGrew, former cowboy star of the silver screen, has never believed in tall tales. But down in Mexico, the land of La Llorona, he’s about to find out just how real urban legends can be.</p>
<p><b>#MAKEHALLOWEENSCARYAGAIN by Mark Allan Gunnells</b> Some people will go to any lengths to rack up retweets, likes, and follows on social media, no matter who they end up hurting . . . or even killing.</p>
<p><b>Praise for Halloween Carnival Volume 1</b></p>
<p>“<i>\\\\[Halloween Carnival: Volume One]</i> provides festive entertainment from an assortment of the genre’s most accomplished regulars.”<b>—Unnerving Magazine</b></p>
<p> “Entertaining . . . I’d suggest reading them in the daytime.”<b>—Journey of a Bookseller</b> </p>
<p>“A solid collection . . . A Halloween fan who reads ebooks can’t go wrong here.”<b>—Battered, Tattered, Yellowed, & Creased</b></p>

<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday. This is something that anyone who knows me will tell you. I am a Halloween fanatic. So when given the chance to review books with stories based on Halloween and Halloween traditions – and those books are horror novels, you can bet I jumped at that chance. <em>Halloween Carnival Volume 1</em> is the first of five volumes of Halloween short stories, each in the horror category.</p>
<p>Volume 1 starts off with a story that isn’t so much scary as weird and sad. It’s a great story and one that I’ve read twice now – in fact I’ve read the entire book twice now – and I have to say that it’s just as weird and sad each time. The book ends with a story that I think belongs more in a mystery &amp; thriller compilation than a horror/Halloween compilation. Again, it’s great story and I’ve read it twice, but I just don’t think it fits so well with the idea of a Halloween/horror story.</p>
<p>The stories are all well written and I think they’d make a great addition to anyone’s Halloween reading list. It takes around 3 hours to finish the book if you read at an average to above average speed, so you could technically get through more than one of these volumes in a day.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 stars because the stories have a good Halloween creepy vibe to them and they work well for those wanting a quick Halloween-themed read.</p>

<p class="review__description">"A fantastic anthology by the true master of horror fiction. Highly recommended." — Book Nutter's Book Reviews</p>
<p>"This is an excellent collection of Lovecraft's 'zombie' stories, which serves both as a treat to old fans and a sampler to people who haven't read Lovecraft before. I would highly recommend this collection." — Of Stacks and Cups</p>
<p>"Highly recommended. A great way to re-animate Lovecraft's standing as a master of the horror genre." — Looking for a Good Book </p>
<p>"A delightfully horrific collection of tales that will thrill any horror fan!" — A Universe in Words</p>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, and other experts on horror fiction deem H. P. Lovecraft the master teller of weird tales. These six chilling stories ― all published between 1921 and 1933 ― offer compelling journeys into the land of the undead. The collection begins with "The Outsider," the tale of a recluse whose overwhelming loneliness emboldens him to seek out human contact. Subsequent stories include "Herbert West ― Reanimator," written as a satire of Frankenstein and used as the source for a popular horror film; "In the Vault," in which an undertaker experiences supernatural revenge; "Cool Air," an account of a doctor's fanatical obsession with defying death; and "Pickman's Model," focusing on an artist's gallery of nightmares. "The Thing on the Doorstep" concludes the compilation with the compelling tale of a man whose body is preyed upon by a spirit that refuses to die. </p>

<p>When I think of zombies, I think of undead beings who stagger around, moaning and groaning, and looking to consume human (or non-human) flesh and/or brains. I think Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, etc.. What I don’t think of, are scientific reanimations of corpses, black magic being used to take over others’ bodies, or any of the other things that happened in this book.</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft is one of the authors that is considered “must read” for any goth – and being a goth I felt that I must give this a try, at least once. I find that I’m not particularly entranced by H. P. Lovecraft’s writing style, nor am I particularly impressed with what the author and publisher chose to consider zombie stories. These were relatively creepy, but not downright scary and quite frankly, didn’t spark anything past mild interest.</p>
<p>I finished the book for the sake of finishing it as it isn’t a particularly long book. The stories were all right, but not worth more than 3 stars.</p>

<p class="review__description">Glen Hirshberg, Lee Thomas, Holly Newstein, Del James, and Al Sarrantonio bring the ghouls of the most haunted night of the year to life in a chilling collection of stories curated by master of horror Brian James Freeman. </p>
<p><b>MR. DARK’S CARNIVAL by Glen Hirshberg</b> Halloween is more than just a holiday in Clarkson, Montana; it’s a tradition passed down through generations. Only this year, the ghosts of the past may just be a little closer than usual.</p>
<p><b>THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF MY SISTER by Lee Thomas</b> When David was young, he believed in magic. In fact, he wanted to become a magician himself. But meddling in the forces of the mind has consequences beyond what an eleven-year-old can see. </p>
<p><b>MISCHIEF NIGHT by Holly Newstein</b> Cabbage Night, Goose Night, Devil’s Night—they’re all the same. Before the treats come the tricks. It’s all in good fun . . . until someone gets hurt.</p>
<p><b>THE GHOST MAKER by Del James</b> When people need to disappear, I make them vanish. The catch? I’ve always got to be on guard—because that knock at the door may not just be a little monster looking for candy.</p>
<p><b>THE PUMPKIN BOY by Al Sarrantonio </b> When boys start going missing, Detective Len Schneider is determined to make it right. But his partner knows that there are worse things out there than a dead kid.</p>

<p>While I loved <strong>Halloween Carnival Volume One</strong>, I wasn’t quite as impressed with <strong>Halloween Carnival Volume Two</strong>.</p>
<p>To my idea, the best story in this batch of five stories was <strong>Mr. Dark’s Carnival</strong> by Glen Hirshberg. It added a twist at the end that I honestly didn’t see coming. I’m not sure why, but I didn’t see it coming. It was awesome, creepy, and just like when I watched <strong>The Sixth Sense</strong>, there were clues that I didn’t realize pointed to the ending.</p>
<p><strong>The Facts in the Case of My Sister</strong> by Lee Thomas wasn’t too bad either. I kind of figured what was going on, but there were a couple of subtle things that startled me that had nothing to do with the actual story line, but were just awesome things to see in the story. While this story was predictable, it was very good.</p>
<p><strong>Mischief Night</strong> by Holly Newstein wasn’t even memorable enough for me to remember what the story was about. I literally finished the book less than 24 hours ago and have no clue what that story was about.</p>
<p><strong>The Ghost Maker</strong> by Del James wasn’t scary or creepy. It didn’t even fit as horror, sci fi, or fantasy. There was nothing horror about it. It was so straight forward that I just didn’t see the point in it being there.</p>
<p><strong>The Pumpkin Boy</strong> by Al Sarrantonio was just plain weird. I have no idea what the author was going for, but I’m assuming weird wasn’t it. It had a plot twist that just didn’t make a lick of sense because you didn’t know enough about the backstory. I think it could have been a better story if the backstory behind it had been better fleshed out.</p>
<p>All in all, the only reason this collection didn’t get 2 stars was because of Mr. Dark’s Carnival – that was a great story and I’d love to see more like that in Volumes 3-5.</p>
