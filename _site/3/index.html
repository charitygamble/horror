<p class="review__description">Robert McCammon, Kevin Lucia, John R. Little, Lisa Morton, and Mark Allan Gunnells put the horror back in Halloween with a quintet of devilishly delightful tales, curated by acclaimed author and editor Brian James Freeman.</p>
<p><b>STRANGE CANDY by Robert McCammon</b> Chocolate bars and sour suckers are trick-or-treat staples, but beware the odd sweet at the bottom of your bag. You never know who it’s from—or what it might do to you.</p>
<p><b>THE RAGE OF ACHILLES by Kevin Lucia</b> Father Ward should have heeded the warnings about hearing confession on All Hallow’s Eve. Because a man is about to tell him a secret more haunting than any he has heard before. </p>
<p><b>DEMON AIR by John R. Little</b> Fear of flying is not uncommon. But on this transpacific airline, the real danger isn’t the flight itself. It’s whoever—or whatever—is up in the air with you.</p>
<p><b>LA HACIENDA DE LOS MUERTOS by Lisa Morton</b> Trick McGrew, former cowboy star of the silver screen, has never believed in tall tales. But down in Mexico, the land of La Llorona, he’s about to find out just how real urban legends can be.</p>
<p><b>#MAKEHALLOWEENSCARYAGAIN by Mark Allan Gunnells</b> Some people will go to any lengths to rack up retweets, likes, and follows on social media, no matter who they end up hurting . . . or even killing.</p>
<p><b>Praise for Halloween Carnival Volume 1</b></p>
<p>“<i>\\\\[Halloween Carnival: Volume One]</i> provides festive entertainment from an assortment of the genre’s most accomplished regulars.”<b>—Unnerving Magazine</b></p>
<p> “Entertaining . . . I’d suggest reading them in the daytime.”<b>—Journey of a Bookseller</b> </p>
<p>“A solid collection . . . A Halloween fan who reads ebooks can’t go wrong here.”<b>—Battered, Tattered, Yellowed, & Creased</b></p>

<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday. This is something that anyone who knows me will tell you. I am a Halloween fanatic. So when given the chance to review books with stories based on Halloween and Halloween traditions – and those books are horror novels, you can bet I jumped at that chance. <em>Halloween Carnival Volume 1</em> is the first of five volumes of Halloween short stories, each in the horror category.</p>
<p>Volume 1 starts off with a story that isn’t so much scary as weird and sad. It’s a great story and one that I’ve read twice now – in fact I’ve read the entire book twice now – and I have to say that it’s just as weird and sad each time. The book ends with a story that I think belongs more in a mystery &amp; thriller compilation than a horror/Halloween compilation. Again, it’s great story and I’ve read it twice, but I just don’t think it fits so well with the idea of a Halloween/horror story.</p>
<p>The stories are all well written and I think they’d make a great addition to anyone’s Halloween reading list. It takes around 3 hours to finish the book if you read at an average to above average speed, so you could technically get through more than one of these volumes in a day.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 stars because the stories have a good Halloween creepy vibe to them and they work well for those wanting a quick Halloween-themed read.</p>

<p class="review__description">"A fantastic anthology by the true master of horror fiction. Highly recommended." — Book Nutter's Book Reviews</p>
<p>"This is an excellent collection of Lovecraft's 'zombie' stories, which serves both as a treat to old fans and a sampler to people who haven't read Lovecraft before. I would highly recommend this collection." — Of Stacks and Cups</p>
<p>"Highly recommended. A great way to re-animate Lovecraft's standing as a master of the horror genre." — Looking for a Good Book </p>
<p>"A delightfully horrific collection of tales that will thrill any horror fan!" — A Universe in Words</p>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, and other experts on horror fiction deem H. P. Lovecraft the master teller of weird tales. These six chilling stories ― all published between 1921 and 1933 ― offer compelling journeys into the land of the undead. The collection begins with "The Outsider," the tale of a recluse whose overwhelming loneliness emboldens him to seek out human contact. Subsequent stories include "Herbert West ― Reanimator," written as a satire of Frankenstein and used as the source for a popular horror film; "In the Vault," in which an undertaker experiences supernatural revenge; "Cool Air," an account of a doctor's fanatical obsession with defying death; and "Pickman's Model," focusing on an artist's gallery of nightmares. "The Thing on the Doorstep" concludes the compilation with the compelling tale of a man whose body is preyed upon by a spirit that refuses to die. </p>

<p>When I think of zombies, I think of undead beings who stagger around, moaning and groaning, and looking to consume human (or non-human) flesh and/or brains. I think Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, etc.. What I don’t think of, are scientific reanimations of corpses, black magic being used to take over others’ bodies, or any of the other things that happened in this book.</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft is one of the authors that is considered “must read” for any goth – and being a goth I felt that I must give this a try, at least once. I find that I’m not particularly entranced by H. P. Lovecraft’s writing style, nor am I particularly impressed with what the author and publisher chose to consider zombie stories. These were relatively creepy, but not downright scary and quite frankly, didn’t spark anything past mild interest.</p>
<p>I finished the book for the sake of finishing it as it isn’t a particularly long book. The stories were all right, but not worth more than 3 stars.</p>

<p class="review__description">A storm is raging. That’s merely one of Detective Daniel Nash’s troubles. Charlie Hamilton, the resident drunk and proprietor of Camp High Tide has mysteriously perished. After combing through old files, he learns that thirty years ago a young boy went missing. His body never discovered. He requests an interview with the five campers who were interrogated during that time.</p>
<p>The bodies of the suspects start piling up. Each death is similar and equally horrifying. Detective Nash must locate the suspects before the culprit has a chance to finish them off.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, this book seems awfully familiar. Probably because the beginning seems like a slightly revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>. And honestly, that’s what this book is. It’s a revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, where the real culprits are the ones who get theirs instead of innocent kids who happened to be reopening the camp or near the lake.</p>
<p>Kids will be kids and bullies abound even at summer camp. Poor Timmy Waters suffers the same fate as Jason Voorhees, only Timmy dies as the result of a prank, not lifeguards and counselors not paying attention. But Timmy isn’t about to let his bullies get away with killing him. The tale is interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn’t be opposed to reading more of E. C. Fisher’s books if they’re all like <strong>The Rain</strong>.</p>
<p>Trust me, you won’t be disappointed with this book at all, if you like horror.</p>
