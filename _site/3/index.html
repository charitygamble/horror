<p class="review__description">Robert McCammon, Kevin Lucia, John R. Little, Lisa Morton, and Mark Allan Gunnells put the horror back in Halloween with a quintet of devilishly delightful tales, curated by acclaimed author and editor Brian James Freeman.</p>
<p><b>STRANGE CANDY by Robert McCammon</b> Chocolate bars and sour suckers are trick-or-treat staples, but beware the odd sweet at the bottom of your bag. You never know who it’s from—or what it might do to you.</p>
<p><b>THE RAGE OF ACHILLES by Kevin Lucia</b> Father Ward should have heeded the warnings about hearing confession on All Hallow’s Eve. Because a man is about to tell him a secret more haunting than any he has heard before. </p>
<p><b>DEMON AIR by John R. Little</b> Fear of flying is not uncommon. But on this transpacific airline, the real danger isn’t the flight itself. It’s whoever—or whatever—is up in the air with you.</p>
<p><b>LA HACIENDA DE LOS MUERTOS by Lisa Morton</b> Trick McGrew, former cowboy star of the silver screen, has never believed in tall tales. But down in Mexico, the land of La Llorona, he’s about to find out just how real urban legends can be.</p>
<p><b>#MAKEHALLOWEENSCARYAGAIN by Mark Allan Gunnells</b> Some people will go to any lengths to rack up retweets, likes, and follows on social media, no matter who they end up hurting . . . or even killing.</p>
<p><b>Praise for Halloween Carnival Volume 1</b></p>
<p>“<i>\\\\[Halloween Carnival: Volume One]</i> provides festive entertainment from an assortment of the genre’s most accomplished regulars.”<b>—Unnerving Magazine</b></p>
<p> “Entertaining . . . I’d suggest reading them in the daytime.”<b>—Journey of a Bookseller</b> </p>
<p>“A solid collection . . . A Halloween fan who reads ebooks can’t go wrong here.”<b>—Battered, Tattered, Yellowed, & Creased</b></p>

<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday. This is something that anyone who knows me will tell you. I am a Halloween fanatic. So when given the chance to review books with stories based on Halloween and Halloween traditions – and those books are horror novels, you can bet I jumped at that chance. <em>Halloween Carnival Volume 1</em> is the first of five volumes of Halloween short stories, each in the horror category.</p>
<p>Volume 1 starts off with a story that isn’t so much scary as weird and sad. It’s a great story and one that I’ve read twice now – in fact I’ve read the entire book twice now – and I have to say that it’s just as weird and sad each time. The book ends with a story that I think belongs more in a mystery &amp; thriller compilation than a horror/Halloween compilation. Again, it’s great story and I’ve read it twice, but I just don’t think it fits so well with the idea of a Halloween/horror story.</p>
<p>The stories are all well written and I think they’d make a great addition to anyone’s Halloween reading list. It takes around 3 hours to finish the book if you read at an average to above average speed, so you could technically get through more than one of these volumes in a day.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 stars because the stories have a good Halloween creepy vibe to them and they work well for those wanting a quick Halloween-themed read.</p>

<p class="review__description">"A fantastic anthology by the true master of horror fiction. Highly recommended." — Book Nutter's Book Reviews</p>
<p>"This is an excellent collection of Lovecraft's 'zombie' stories, which serves both as a treat to old fans and a sampler to people who haven't read Lovecraft before. I would highly recommend this collection." — Of Stacks and Cups</p>
<p>"Highly recommended. A great way to re-animate Lovecraft's standing as a master of the horror genre." — Looking for a Good Book </p>
<p>"A delightfully horrific collection of tales that will thrill any horror fan!" — A Universe in Words</p>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, and other experts on horror fiction deem H. P. Lovecraft the master teller of weird tales. These six chilling stories ― all published between 1921 and 1933 ― offer compelling journeys into the land of the undead. The collection begins with "The Outsider," the tale of a recluse whose overwhelming loneliness emboldens him to seek out human contact. Subsequent stories include "Herbert West ― Reanimator," written as a satire of Frankenstein and used as the source for a popular horror film; "In the Vault," in which an undertaker experiences supernatural revenge; "Cool Air," an account of a doctor's fanatical obsession with defying death; and "Pickman's Model," focusing on an artist's gallery of nightmares. "The Thing on the Doorstep" concludes the compilation with the compelling tale of a man whose body is preyed upon by a spirit that refuses to die. </p>

<p>When I think of zombies, I think of undead beings who stagger around, moaning and groaning, and looking to consume human (or non-human) flesh and/or brains. I think Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, etc.. What I don’t think of, are scientific reanimations of corpses, black magic being used to take over others’ bodies, or any of the other things that happened in this book.</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft is one of the authors that is considered “must read” for any goth – and being a goth I felt that I must give this a try, at least once. I find that I’m not particularly entranced by H. P. Lovecraft’s writing style, nor am I particularly impressed with what the author and publisher chose to consider zombie stories. These were relatively creepy, but not downright scary and quite frankly, didn’t spark anything past mild interest.</p>
<p>I finished the book for the sake of finishing it as it isn’t a particularly long book. The stories were all right, but not worth more than 3 stars.</p>

<p class="review__description">Kelley Armstrong, Kate Maruyama, Michael McBride, Taylor Grant, and Greg Chapman unleash the unsettled spirits of the past in five frightening stories collected by celebrated editor, author, and horror guru Brian James Freeman.</p>
<p><b>THE WAY LOST by Kelley Armstrong </b> The kids in Franklin don’t ask questions. Each Halloween, one of them disappears into the forest. Dale promised his mother he’d never go into the woods alone. But the kids in Franklin also lie.</p>
<p><b>LA CALAVERA by Kate Maruyama</b> The Día de los Muertos Festival at the Hollywood Cemetery used to be ours. Now, without Jasmine, it’s only right that I go one last time in her honor—before I let her go for good.... </p>
<p><b>THE DEVIL’S DUE by Michael McBride</b> Pine Springs, Colorado, has prospered for generations by honoring its traditions and its promises. Then one man refuses to do his civic duty—and the price he must pay is fatally steep.</p>
<p><b>A THOUSAND ROOMS OF DARKNESS by Taylor Grant</b> Samhainophobia: an irrational fear of Halloween. Phasmophobia: an irrational fear of ghosts. For Anne, these terrors are more rational than she knows.</p>
<p><b>THE LAST NIGHT OF OCTOBER by Greg Chapman</b> Every year, one little boy wearing a grotesque Frankenstein mask comes knocking at Gerald’s door. Gerald has always managed to avoid him . . . until this year.</p>

<p>Ok, so this one was better than Volume 2, but not quite as good as Volume 1. But I will say, <strong>Halloween Carnival Volume 3</strong> is a solid offering for horror fans and for those who prefer more tame Halloween stories.</p>
<p><strong>The Way Lost</strong> was one of my favorites out of Volume 3. I found it to have a plot twist, more than one actually, that really threw me for a loop. While this one wasn’t scary – I’d call it more of a mystery than horror – it was a damn good story and one I read over and over.</p>
<p><strong>La Calavera</strong> was all right, but it a bit too predictable in my opinion. I had the ending pretty much pegged less than halfway through the story. Maybe I’ve just read too many stories that work like that, but I wasn’t surprised nor did I think it was particularly creepy. The only reason I can think of for it being included was the Halloween theme.</p>
<p><strong>The Devil’s Due</strong> was a damn good story. I just wish the ending would have been better. I don’t know, it just seemed to me that the story could have had a much more exciting ending than it did. I felt that the ending was disappointing after the action that happened before it. Maybe it was just me. I’d love to see the story edited and a better ending added.</p>
<p><strong>A Thousand Rooms of Darkness</strong> was an awesome story. The idea of someone being terrified of both ghosts and Halloween is just unreal to me, but when you add in the plot twists toward the end it all makes sense. And those plot twists are to die for. Trust me on this one. You’ll love them… because you definitely won’t expect these!</p>
<p><strong>The Last Night of October</strong> was the longest story as I recall and honestly, it wasn’t that scary to me. Some of the things in it didn’t make a lot of sense, at least not to me. And let me say – in my humble opinion, the “it is my fault _____ is dead and now they’re back to haunt/take me” trope is just over done. I would rather have seen it be something else like “it is my fault _____ is dead and now they’re back, but if I apologize or tell the story of what happened they’ll go away and leave me alone.” I mean, really, I would, because that never happens.</p>
<p>This one got 4 stars because <strong>The Way Lost, The Devil’s Due, and A Thousand Rooms of Darkness</strong> were great stories.</p>
