  <span class="when__posted">Posted on <span class="why__me">10-21-22</span> - by Charli</span>
  <article class="the__post"><p>N﻿early every one of us has a classic horror movie or classic horror movie series/franchise that is near and dear to our hearts. Whether your favorite classic horror movie is John Carpenter's Halloween, Friday the 13th, Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, or any other classic horror movie, chances are if it was popular in its day, there has either been a remake of it done or one has been planned. These remakes are often a bone of contention among horror fans and you often read &quot;Hollywood doesn't have an original movie anymore&quot; and &quot;why can't they just stop with the remakes, leave the classics alone&quot;. Well, allow me to explain why remakes are done and why it isn't actually a bad thing to make remakes.</p>
<h3>Why Remakes Are Made</h3>
<p>O﻿ne thing I see a lot of people ask when movies, especially classic horror movies, are scheduled for a remake is &quot;Why don't they make new movies instead of remakes of older movies?&quot;. Well, the answer is actually quite simple - older movies have brand recognition. If a movie studio says they're going to do a remake of Pumpkin Head, Puppet Master, or Night of the Living Dead, there is always going to be someone who knows what movie they're talking about. The recognition of the brand is there. Even if younger generations of horror fans haven't seen the original movies, they've probably at least heard of them.</p>
<p>R﻿emakes allow movie studios to bring older movies back to the forefront of society's minds. It gives them a chance to say &quot;hey, while these other, brand new, movies are in production, check out a new, updated version of a movie that made these new ones possible&quot;. On this front, it is a money-making ploy, but it is a good one.</p>
<h3>Why Remakes Aren't Bad</h3>
<p>S﻿o why aren't remakes bad? Well, think about it. Younger generations might not have seen John Carpenter's Halloween, but they've almost certainly seen Rob Zombie's Halloween. Same with Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street - the younger generations probably haven't seen it, but they've seen the 2010 remake of it. Remakes introduce younger generations of horror fans to movies that they might not have seen or heard of before. You can bet that someone will educate them that the movie is actually a remake, which may cause the younger generations of horror fans to look for and watch the originals. This could spark an interest in the original movies for these younger fans.</p>
<p>A﻿nother reason remakes aren't all bad is because it gives a fresh perspective. While Wes Craven's series of A Nightmare on Elm Street movies does allude to Freddy Krueger being a pedophile, the 2010 remake of the first movie relies heavily on that idea. Also, in some cases, it's kind of amusing to see people with cell phones and laptops and SUVs in movies when the originals didn't have those things because they didn't really exist yet.</p>
<p>N﻿ow, I'm not saying remakes aren't bad in terms of content because let's face it, some of them are downright awful. Friday the 13th, I'm looking at you. I hated that remake and I've never watched it again. But I love, and own, Rob Zombie's remakes of Halloween and Halloween II. I didn't think the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street was a bad film at all. Different, yes, very much so. But it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it and I'd watch it again.</p>
<p>I﻿nstead of looking down on horror movie remakes, why don't we try giving them a chance? At least watch the remake one time before passing judgment on a movie that may not be nearly as bad as you think just because it is a remake. Also, maybe we should stop saying Hollywood doesn't have an original thought or movie anymore because there are far more new horror movies being made and released than remakes. Just a thought.</p>

  <span class="when__posted">Posted on <span class="why__me">10-11-22</span> - by Charli</span>
  <article class="the__post"><p>Welcome to The Horror Revue - a blog where I review horror books, movies, and TV shows. I've always been a fan of horror movies, books, and TV shows. I remember watching &quot;Tales from the Dark Side&quot; late at night on Saturday nights with my sister and her friend. To me, they weren't particularly scary but they could be unsettling. Another show we liked to watch was Friday the 13th - the series. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I was watching horror flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween with my friends. All through my teen years, my mom would buy me horror novels while she bought herself romance novels at our local used bookstore. So my love of horror has been with me for a long time.</p>
<p>So now that you know a little background... welcome to the circus!</p>
