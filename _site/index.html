<p>Release Year: 2021<br></p>
<p>Director: David Gordon Green<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Surviving victims of Michael Myers form a vigilante mob and vow to end his reign of terror after they discover that he is still alive.</p>
<p>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>
</div>
<p>I﻿f you know me, you know that I love the Halloween series. Not the biggest fan of <em>Halloween III: Season of the Witch</em>, but now that I know the reasoning behind why it doesn't fit with the rest of the series, I'm not going to go off on a tangent regarding the movie.</p>
<p>N﻿ow in case you aren't aware, with these last three movies, <em>Halloween (2018)</em>, <em>Halloween Kills</em>, and <em>Halloween Ends</em>, John Carpenter and David Gordon Green retconned <em>Halloween 4 - Resurrection</em>. In this case, they decided that those events never actually happened. Some sources say that <em>Halloween 2</em> was also part of the retconning, which at first I'd doubted, but thinking back on a few scenes in <em>Halloween Kills</em>, I'm inclined to think it's true.</p>
<p>S﻿o when we enter <em>Halloween Kills</em>, we're entering more or less where <em>Halloween (2018)</em> left off. The movie is pretty good, not the best movie ever and certainly not the best movie in the Halloween series (that distinction goes to <em>Halloween Ends</em>, review to come). But there are some pretty darned good scenes in the movie, including a possible explanation for why Michael was alive to come back 40 years after he'd murdered Laurie's friends and almost killed her. I say possible because this *is* Michael Myers we're talking about.</p>
<p>Possible spoiler alert, although I'm pretty sure this has been mentioned in other Halloween movies, but at one point you'll hear Laurie say that Michael is nearly impossible to kill/get rid of. Which we've seen from other movies. But if the series was retconned clear back to the end of <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, how would she know? If <em>Halloween 2</em>'s events never happened, how would she know? I mean, when Loomis shot Michael in <em>Halloween (1978)</em>, we can always make the argument that he missed anything vital, which is how <em>Halloween 2</em> happened. But if none of the others happened, how would she know that he was hard to kill?</p>
<p>T﻿his movie showcases exactly how difficult Michael is to kill, based on one scene alone. All I can say is, he should have been at very least paralyzed, if not flat out dead.</p>
<p>Despite these plot holes and issues, this was a really good movie. Not fantastic, but really good. It gave a good bit of social commentary on how we can end up with a mob mentality and not care what is actually going on when we collectively decide something. The court of public opinion and all. Even when being told they're wrong, the mob will always stay their course.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, this movie was a great addition to the series - even if it does take part in retconning a bunch of the movies. I recommend you give this one a watch - and definitely watch it before you watch <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p>

  <h5 class="when__posted">Posted on <span class="why__me">10-21-22</span> - by Charli</h5>
  <article class="the__post"><p>N﻿early every one of us has a classic horror movie or classic horror movie series/franchise that is near and dear to our hearts. Whether your favorite classic horror movie is John Carpenter's Halloween, Friday the 13th, Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, or any other classic horror movie, chances are if it was popular in its day, there has either been a remake of it done or one has been planned. These remakes are often a bone of contention among horror fans and you often read &quot;Hollywood doesn't have an original movie anymore&quot; and &quot;why can't they just stop with the remakes, leave the classics alone&quot;. Well, allow me to explain why remakes are done and why it isn't actually a bad thing to make remakes.</p>
<h3>Why Remakes Are Made</h3>
<p>O﻿ne thing I see a lot of people ask when movies, especially classic horror movies, are scheduled for a remake is &quot;Why don't they make new movies instead of remakes of older movies?&quot;. Well, the answer is actually quite simple - older movies have brand recognition. If a movie studio says they're going to do a remake of Pumpkin Head, Puppet Master, or Night of the Living Dead, there is always going to be someone who knows what movie they're talking about. The recognition of the brand is there. Even if younger generations of horror fans haven't seen the original movies, they've probably at least heard of them.</p>
<p>R﻿emakes allow movie studios to bring older movies back to the forefront of society's minds. It gives them a chance to say &quot;hey, while these other, brand new, movies are in production, check out a new, updated version of a movie that made these new ones possible&quot;. On this front, it is a money-making ploy, but it is a good one.</p>
<h3>Why Remakes Aren't Bad</h3>
<p>S﻿o why aren't remakes bad? Well, think about it. Younger generations might not have seen John Carpenter's Halloween, but they've almost certainly seen Rob Zombie's Halloween. Same with Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street - the younger generations probably haven't seen it, but they've seen the 2010 remake of it. Remakes introduce younger generations of horror fans to movies that they might not have seen or heard of before. You can bet that someone will educate them that the movie is actually a remake, which may cause the younger generations of horror fans to look for and watch the originals. This could spark an interest in the original movies for these younger fans.</p>
<p>A﻿nother reason remakes aren't all bad is because it gives a fresh perspective. While Wes Craven's series of A Nightmare on Elm Street movies does allude to Freddy Krueger being a pedophile, the 2010 remake of the first movie relies heavily on that idea. Also, in some cases, it's kind of amusing to see people with cell phones and laptops and SUVs in movies when the originals didn't have those things because they didn't really exist yet.</p>
<p>N﻿ow, I'm not saying remakes aren't bad in terms of content because let's face it, some of them are downright awful. Friday the 13th, I'm looking at you. I hated that remake and I've never watched it again. But I love, and own, Rob Zombie's remakes of Halloween and Halloween II. I didn't think the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street was a bad film at all. Different, yes, very much so. But it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it and I'd watch it again.</p>
<p>I﻿nstead of looking down on horror movie remakes, why don't we try giving them a chance? At least watch the remake one time before passing judgment on a movie that may not be nearly as bad as you think just because it is a remake. Also, maybe we should stop saying Hollywood doesn't have an original thought or movie anymore because there are far more new horror movies being made and released than remakes. Just a thought.</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="movie__poster" src="/static/images/movie/pieces1982.webp" width="200" height="300" alt="Movie Poster for Pieces - 1982" align="left">
<p>Release Year: 1982<br></p>
<p>Director: Juan Piquer Simón<br></p>
<p>IT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!</p>
<p>A frustrated Boston detective searches for the maniac responsible for mutilating a number of university coeds.</p>
<p>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</p>
</div>
<p>W﻿hen I looked into watching this one, the poster on Shudder said &quot;You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre&quot;. I thought that was kind of funny so I decided to give it a look. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the chainsaw massacre. It wasn't even really a massacre.</p>
<p>I﻿t kind of floors me that this movie was released after the original <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, yet it's so much different . It was almost as if the writers and the director were trying to cash in on the idea of <em>TCM</em>, but without having to go to all the trouble to make it actually be like <em>TCM</em>. Then they turn around and try to compare it to the classic.</p>
<p>T﻿he movie isn't terrible. It is a bit hokey, but we all know that most horror movies from that era aren't really scary and have terrible special effects - although they were &quot;cutting edge&quot; at the time. I will say that this one could have done a better job of keeping you guessing. You pretty much can guess who is doing all the killing once you you hear what one of the victims says to him.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, it isn't a bad movie and I'd watch it again.</p>
