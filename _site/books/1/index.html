<p class="review__description"><b>Soon to be a major motion picture coming to Netflix in 2021!</b></p>
<p><b>“A heart-pounding page-turner with an outstanding cast of characters, a deliciously creepy setting, and an absolutely merciless body count.” –Courtney Summers, New York Times bestselling author of Sadie and The Project</b></p>
<p><b>A New York Times bestseller</b></p>
<p>It’s been almost a year since Makani Young came to live with her grandmother and she’s still adjusting to her new life in rural Nebraska. Then, one by one, students at her high school begin to die in a series of gruesome murders, each with increasing and grotesque flair.</p>
<p>As the body count rises and the terror grows closer, can Makani survive the killer’s twisted plan?</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been wanting to read There’s Someone Inside Your House since I first started hearing about it, before it came out. Back then, it was a book that had some hype to it – people were getting really cool packages for this book. I wasn’t lucky enough to receive one of the packages and eventually the book fell off my radar. But the other day it was on display as a slasher/horror book for Halloween at the library and I remembered how much I wanted to read it, so I snagged it. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Written by Stephanie Perkins, the same author of Anna and the French Kiss, this book definitely isn’t Anna and the French Kiss, or the rest of that trilogy either. This book is completely different. Those books were, as I recall, more contemporary romance type YA books. This is all thriller/horror. Trust me.</p>
<p>The writing was great. It was easy to read and the writing style helped keep my interest. The action starts from the very beginning, but in my opinion, the best thrillers do have action from the very beginning. I rarely like thrillers that start off slowly.</p>
<p>As for the characters, I love Makani. She’s fierce, loyal, and honestly, her secret just didn’t seem to be all that bad in the bigger scheme of things. Her idea that she might deserve to have the killer’s attention turned to her is just ludicrous in my opinion. I also loved Ollie. He was a great match for Makani and she brought him out of his shell a great deal. Plus, he made other friends in the process. Darby was great, though I cannot speak to the accuracy of the transgender representation, suffice it to say that I was glad to see there was transgender representation in this book. So many books I’ve read with LGBTQIA+ characters don’t cover trans characters. Alex was annoying but funny and I loved her character as well. We didn’t get as much of Darby and Alex as I might have liked, but the book wasn’t really about them.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the action started right away. But I think it was necessary to set the tone and mood for the book. This was someone who was gaslighting his/her victims. This killer was playing with his/her victims’ minds before killing them. This killer took their time. The sick, twisted cat-and-mouse game played the killer played with the victims is honestly terrifying. Imagine finding objects in places they don’t belong, objects just plain missing, and thinking that something might be wrong with you. That’s what this killer did to his/her victims before actually killing them.</p>
<p>The one thing that was never explained was the reasoning behind the way each body was mutilated and that kind of bothered me. Each body was mutilated in a different way but there was never an explanation given for the mutilation, only the explanation for why the killer did what he/she did. That’s one of the few complaints I had for this book was the lack of explanation.</p>
<p>I gave this book four stars on Goodreads because it truly is a great book. I’m hoping to see more thrillers from Stephanie Perkins because she does have a knack for it.</p>

<p class="review__description">"A fantastic anthology by the true master of horror fiction. Highly recommended." — Book Nutter's Book Reviews</p>
<p>"This is an excellent collection of Lovecraft's 'zombie' stories, which serves both as a treat to old fans and a sampler to people who haven't read Lovecraft before. I would highly recommend this collection." — Of Stacks and Cups</p>
<p>"Highly recommended. A great way to re-animate Lovecraft's standing as a master of the horror genre." — Looking for a Good Book </p>
<p>"A delightfully horrific collection of tales that will thrill any horror fan!" — A Universe in Words</p>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, and other experts on horror fiction deem H. P. Lovecraft the master teller of weird tales. These six chilling stories ― all published between 1921 and 1933 ― offer compelling journeys into the land of the undead. The collection begins with "The Outsider," the tale of a recluse whose overwhelming loneliness emboldens him to seek out human contact. Subsequent stories include "Herbert West ― Reanimator," written as a satire of Frankenstein and used as the source for a popular horror film; "In the Vault," in which an undertaker experiences supernatural revenge; "Cool Air," an account of a doctor's fanatical obsession with defying death; and "Pickman's Model," focusing on an artist's gallery of nightmares. "The Thing on the Doorstep" concludes the compilation with the compelling tale of a man whose body is preyed upon by a spirit that refuses to die. </p>

<p>When I think of zombies, I think of undead beings who stagger around, moaning and groaning, and looking to consume human (or non-human) flesh and/or brains. I think Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, etc.. What I don’t think of, are scientific reanimations of corpses, black magic being used to take over others’ bodies, or any of the other things that happened in this book.</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft is one of the authors that is considered “must read” for any goth – and being a goth I felt that I must give this a try, at least once. I find that I’m not particularly entranced by H. P. Lovecraft’s writing style, nor am I particularly impressed with what the author and publisher chose to consider zombie stories. These were relatively creepy, but not downright scary and quite frankly, didn’t spark anything past mild interest.</p>
<p>I finished the book for the sake of finishing it as it isn’t a particularly long book. The stories were all right, but not worth more than 3 stars.</p>

<p class="review__description">Richard Chizmar, Lisa Tuttle, Norman Prentiss, Kevin Quigley, and Peter Straub unmask monsters hiding in plain sight in an anthology of heart-pounding short fiction assembled by horror author and editor Brian James Freeman. </p>
<p><b>DEVIL’S NIGHT by Richard Chizmar</b> You’ve read about what happened that night. What you don’t know is the true extent of the damage. The papers got it wrong—and the truth is so much worse than you thought.</p>
<p><b>THE LAST DARE by Lisa Tuttle</b> Elaine hasn’t been back to her hometown in years. The house she lived in is gone. The tower house isn’t—nor are the stories of the fate that befalls whoever dares to go there.</p>
<p><b>THE HALLOWEEN BLEED by Norman Prentiss</b> People think there’s some sort of mystical power that allows enchantments and witchcraft to come to life on Halloween night. But real magic obeys no calendar—and true evil strikes whenever it’s least expected.</p>
<p><b>SWING by Kevin Quigley</b> In Hollywood, everyone lives forever. At least that’s what I used to think . . . before Jessica. But no one seems to live long when they’re around me.</p>
<p><b>PORK PIE HAT by Peter Straub</b> When it comes to jazz, there are players, and there are legends. “Hat” was a legend. His real name didn’t even matter. Still, he had his secrets—secrets best left buried in the past.</p>

<p>You would think with a high profile author like Peter Straub contributing to this anthology, it would have been better. But nope.</p>
<p>We start off with <strong>Devil’s Night</strong>. It wasn’t the greatest story, but it wasn’t a horrible one either. It was a little bit on the messy side, but hey, it was a short story by an author I’ve never heard of before. The slight plot twist was pretty cool but I felt the ending was a bit on the rushed side, like the author ran out of steam or ideas and just wrote whatever came to mind first.</p>
<p><strong>The Last Dare</strong> is, well, weird. Every city/town has that one house that everyone says is haunted. This one has a house with a chest that apparently eats kids? I was never quite sure what was going on with this story, to be honest. And the ending just left me completely unsatisfied because I couldn’t figure out what was going on. Not a fan of this one at all.</p>
<p><strong>The Halloween Bleed</strong> was another “huh?” story for me. I spent a good portion of the time trying to figure out what was going on. It seemed to me by the end it was some sort of “wizard vs witch” magic shootout? I honestly have no idea and honestly, I was so bored during this story I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>Swing</strong> was… interesting. Honestly, it seems to me that it was written from the perspective of a Grim Reaper who deals exclusively in suicide victims. Which was pretty cool. It also seemed to me that said Reaper wasn’t particularly thrilled with his or her job and was quite sad about it. I liked this one, but it wasn’t enough to save this book.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we have <strong>Pork Pie Hat</strong>. I would have thought a story by Peter Straub that took up almost half the book would have been better. Instead, I found myself bored and wondering when the story would be over. The only logical explanation I can come up with is that this is one of his early works. Because otherwise, I just can’t with this story.</p>
<p>This one was just as bad as Volume 4. It gets 1 star because it just wasn’t a good anthology for Halloween stories.</p>
