<p><strong>Book:</strong> <em>Chasing the Boogeyman</em><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Richard Chizmar<br>
<strong>Publication Date:</strong> August 17, 2021<br>

<p class="review__description">The New York Times bestselling coauthor of <em>Gwendy’s Button Box</em> brings his signature “thrilling, page-turning” (Michael Koryta, author of How It Happened) prose to this story of small-town evil that combines the storytelling of Stephen King with the true-crime suspense of Michelle McNamara.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1988, the mutilated bodies of several missing girls begin to turn up in a small Maryland town. The grisly evidence leads police to the terrifying assumption that a serial killer is on the loose in the quiet suburb. But soon a rumor begins to spread that the evil stalking local teens is not entirely human. Law enforcement, as well as members of the FBI are certain that the killer is a living, breathing madman—and he’s playing games with them. For a once peaceful community trapped in the depths of paranoia and suspicion, it feels like a nightmare that will never end.</p>
<p>Recent college graduate Richard Chizmar returns to his hometown just as a curfew is enacted and a neighborhood watch is formed. In the midst of preparing for his wedding and embarking on a writing career, he soon finds himself thrust into the real-life horror story. Inspired by the terrifying events, Richard writes a personal account of the serial killer’s reign of terror, unaware that these events will continue to haunt him for years to come.</p>
<p>A clever, terrifying, and heartrending work of metafiction, <em>Chasing the Boogeyman</em> is the ultimate marriage between horror fiction and true crime. Chizmar’s “brilliant…absolutely fascinating, totally compelling, and immediately poignant” (C.J. Tudor, New York Times bestselling author) writing is on full display in this truly unique novel that will haunt you long after you turn the final page..</p>

<p>CW: Death, Suicide, Murder, Animal Cruelty, Animal Death (mention)</p>
<p>This book y’all – let me tell you about <strong>Chasing the Boogeyman</strong> by Richard Chizmar. This book is suspense/crime/horror novel written in the style of a true crime book. But wait – there’s more! Mr. Chizmar not only wrote this book in the style of a true crime book, he included elements of reality in the book. But here’s the catch – you don’t know which is which.</p>
<p>When you read Chasing the Boogeyman, you have no idea what parts of the book are real and what parts are fictional. So as you’re reading the book and looking at the photographs, you don’t know if what you’re reading and looking at is real or fiction. It is a tad bit disconcerting knowing that part of it is fiction, part of it is real, and not knowing the difference between them.</p>
<p>I will say that I started to get an inkling of who might have been the bad guy in this book, but it was between two people, then went down to one. There was a clue in the book that kind of helped me figure out who it might have been, but that doesn’t mean the story wasn’t absolutely awesome. Because it was awesome. The photos were a great touch, just like you’d find in a true crime book – but at the end of each chapter instead of stuck in the middle of the book like most true crime books I’ve read. This gives you a much better sense of what the photos refer to and what they mean.</p>
<p>The ending was super satisfying as well. Obviously I’m not going to give it away but I will say one thing. When you get to the end of the book, you’ll be rewarded for your efforts. No, I’m not going to tell you what that is either. You’ll have to read the book to find out.</p>
<p>I rated this one five stars because I could not put this book down. I had to know what was happening next. I had to know who the bad guy was, even though I had an idea, it didn’t mean I was right. And no, I wasn’t disappointed, even though I was right.</p>
<p>If you like true crime, crime novels, horror, mystery, suspense, or thriller, I highly recommend you pick this book up. This book is an amazing blend of these genres and it is an absolute can’t miss!</p>

<p class="review__description">"A fantastic anthology by the true master of horror fiction. Highly recommended." — Book Nutter's Book Reviews</p>
<p>"This is an excellent collection of Lovecraft's 'zombie' stories, which serves both as a treat to old fans and a sampler to people who haven't read Lovecraft before. I would highly recommend this collection." — Of Stacks and Cups</p>
<p>"Highly recommended. A great way to re-animate Lovecraft's standing as a master of the horror genre." — Looking for a Good Book </p>
<p>"A delightfully horrific collection of tales that will thrill any horror fan!" — A Universe in Words</p>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates, Stephen King, and other experts on horror fiction deem H. P. Lovecraft the master teller of weird tales. These six chilling stories ― all published between 1921 and 1933 ― offer compelling journeys into the land of the undead. The collection begins with "The Outsider," the tale of a recluse whose overwhelming loneliness emboldens him to seek out human contact. Subsequent stories include "Herbert West ― Reanimator," written as a satire of Frankenstein and used as the source for a popular horror film; "In the Vault," in which an undertaker experiences supernatural revenge; "Cool Air," an account of a doctor's fanatical obsession with defying death; and "Pickman's Model," focusing on an artist's gallery of nightmares. "The Thing on the Doorstep" concludes the compilation with the compelling tale of a man whose body is preyed upon by a spirit that refuses to die. </p>

<p>When I think of zombies, I think of undead beings who stagger around, moaning and groaning, and looking to consume human (or non-human) flesh and/or brains. I think Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, etc.. What I don’t think of, are scientific reanimations of corpses, black magic being used to take over others’ bodies, or any of the other things that happened in this book.</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft is one of the authors that is considered “must read” for any goth – and being a goth I felt that I must give this a try, at least once. I find that I’m not particularly entranced by H. P. Lovecraft’s writing style, nor am I particularly impressed with what the author and publisher chose to consider zombie stories. These were relatively creepy, but not downright scary and quite frankly, didn’t spark anything past mild interest.</p>
<p>I finished the book for the sake of finishing it as it isn’t a particularly long book. The stories were all right, but not worth more than 3 stars.</p>

<p class="review__description">Horror Thriller Novels</p>
<p>This is a horror story of a man who began to see hallucinations, had so many battles to fight with, killing a king in his sleep, and a lady who was kidnapped by a man, who she doesn't know her plans, but she's not sure if she would make it out alive. If you are considering the shortest and most intriguing horror story, you found yourself one. This is the best story for you .with the right suspense.</p>

<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from BookSprout to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what the author was actually going for, because if he was truly going for a psychological thriller, he missed the mark. There was nothing thrilling or scary about this book. At all. There might have been some psychological things going on, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p><em>DE’FEAR</em> is a collection of two extremely short stories meant to set you on edge. While the second one did leave off on a fairly interesting cliffhanger, I have to say that neither story was particularly grabbing. The book was all of 24 pages on my iPhone’s iBooks, and the book hasn’t even been put on Goodreads as of this post being written.</p>
<p>I found the writing style to be juvenile, which I suppose is to be expected as it appears this is M. J. Reese’s first book and he is self-publishing. This means he is also self-editing which indicates that while he is trying, and I commend him for that, I believe he could benefit from some professional assistance with his writing.</p>
<p>The stories have potential, but sadly they read like the hurriedly jotted down ideas of a writer’s mind that whirls far too fast to keep up with. I believe if M. J. Reese were to sit down and work on just one of those ideas and make it an actual full length novel, he might be able to get his career going. As it is now, I am sad to say that a writer who just needs some guidance may never end up seeing the light of day.</p>
