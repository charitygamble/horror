<p class="review__description">The New York Times bestselling coauthor of <em>Gwendy’s Button Box</em> brings his signature “thrilling, page-turning” (Michael Koryta, author of How It Happened) prose to this story of small-town evil that combines the storytelling of Stephen King with the true-crime suspense of Michelle McNamara.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1988, the mutilated bodies of several missing girls begin to turn up in a small Maryland town. The grisly evidence leads police to the terrifying assumption that a serial killer is on the loose in the quiet suburb. But soon a rumor begins to spread that the evil stalking local teens is not entirely human. Law enforcement, as well as members of the FBI are certain that the killer is a living, breathing madman—and he’s playing games with them. For a once peaceful community trapped in the depths of paranoia and suspicion, it feels like a nightmare that will never end.</p>
<p>Recent college graduate Richard Chizmar returns to his hometown just as a curfew is enacted and a neighborhood watch is formed. In the midst of preparing for his wedding and embarking on a writing career, he soon finds himself thrust into the real-life horror story. Inspired by the terrifying events, Richard writes a personal account of the serial killer’s reign of terror, unaware that these events will continue to haunt him for years to come.</p>
<p>A clever, terrifying, and heartrending work of metafiction, <em>Chasing the Boogeyman</em> is the ultimate marriage between horror fiction and true crime. Chizmar’s “brilliant…absolutely fascinating, totally compelling, and immediately poignant” (C.J. Tudor, New York Times bestselling author) writing is on full display in this truly unique novel that will haunt you long after you turn the final page..</p>

<p>CW: Death, Suicide, Murder, Animal Cruelty, Animal Death (mention)</p>
<p>This book y’all – let me tell you about <strong>Chasing the Boogeyman</strong> by Richard Chizmar. This book is suspense/crime/horror novel written in the style of a true crime book. But wait – there’s more! Mr. Chizmar not only wrote this book in the style of a true crime book, he included elements of reality in the book. But here’s the catch – you don’t know which is which.</p>
<p>When you read Chasing the Boogeyman, you have no idea what parts of the book are real and what parts are fictional. So as you’re reading the book and looking at the photographs, you don’t know if what you’re reading and looking at is real or fiction. It is a tad bit disconcerting knowing that part of it is fiction, part of it is real, and not knowing the difference between them.</p>
<p>I will say that I started to get an inkling of who might have been the bad guy in this book, but it was between two people, then went down to one. There was a clue in the book that kind of helped me figure out who it might have been, but that doesn’t mean the story wasn’t absolutely awesome. Because it was awesome. The photos were a great touch, just like you’d find in a true crime book – but at the end of each chapter instead of stuck in the middle of the book like most true crime books I’ve read. This gives you a much better sense of what the photos refer to and what they mean.</p>
<p>The ending was super satisfying as well. Obviously I’m not going to give it away but I will say one thing. When you get to the end of the book, you’ll be rewarded for your efforts. No, I’m not going to tell you what that is either. You’ll have to read the book to find out.</p>
<p>I rated this one five stars because I could not put this book down. I had to know what was happening next. I had to know who the bad guy was, even though I had an idea, it didn’t mean I was right. And no, I wasn’t disappointed, even though I was right.</p>
<p>If you like true crime, crime novels, horror, mystery, suspense, or thriller, I highly recommend you pick this book up. This book is an amazing blend of these genres and it is an absolute can’t miss!</p>

<p class="review__description"><b>Say thy prayers, ye devil-tongued fools, lest the Wing-Maker come for you.</b></p>
<p><b>"...the comparisons to Thomas Harris are well-earned."</b> -Danielle R., NetGalley reviewer</p>
<p><b>"...this is the BEST book I have read to date."</b> --Laura, Goodreads reviewer</p>
<p><b>"Smart, dark, gritty."</b> --Brittney, NetGalley reviewer</p>
<p><b>MINDHUNTER meets HANNIBAL LECTER in this brilliantly crafted and disturbing thriller from Birgitte Märgen, the haunting new voice of horror and suspense. In the tradition of Thomas Harris, Michael Connelly, and Jo Nesbø, <i>THE PVRITAN</i> is a thriller fueled by a serial killer terrorizing Boston and the detectives trying to stop him. Who is the Wing-Maker? Can he be stopped, or has the soul of his next victim already taken flight?</b></p>
<p>A MAN'S BODY is found hanging in the Boston Common, his eyes missing and skin mutilated beyond recognition, transforming him into a winged demon. Weeks later, a young girl's body is discovered under a layer of ice, her skin carved into angel wings.</p>
<p>Boston Homicide Detective Marti Zucco and her partner, Detective Neil Cavanaugh, are in a race against time to stop the wing-maker, a twisted psychopath who has left a trail of complex clues. A gang-ridden path that will take them through the gates of Hell and into an underground world of sexual perversion.
<p>For Marti, her faith will be tested as more bodies continue to mount and she walks among the ghosts, following in the footprints of the killer known as the Puritan.</p></p>

</blockquote>
<p>CW: The Pvritan contains violence, gore, murder, language, animal death, abuse, suicide, and religion</p>
<h2>The Pvritan Plot</h2>
<p>I thought The Pvritan’s plot was both unique and standard. Standard in the sense that it was a typical murder mystery with police detectives featuring as the main characters. Unique in that it used gruesome imagery for the murders, as well as a mix of both likely and unlikely murder victims. Usually the victims are either all likely victims or all unlikely victims. That there was a mix of these types was refreshing.</p>
<p>I was also impressed with the way Birgitte Märgen interspersed bits and pieces about the murderer through the story. She tries to give the reader a feel for the murderer and who he/she is without giving away who he/she is. It’s very interesting to get glimpses in to the mind of our killer.</p>
<p>Another thing I was impressed with plot-wise were the twists. Just when you think you might have something figured out, a curveball gets thrown at you. You’re suddenly not understanding what on earth is going on.</p>
<h2>The Pvritan Characters</h2>
<h3>Detective Marti Zucco</h3>
<p>I really like Marti. She’s dedicated to her job – perhaps a bit too dedicated. She has an aversion to birds that I would dearly love to know the full story behind and it is highly apparent in the story. She isn’t great with people, and it’s pretty obvious. Of course, she also has a tragic backstory to go along with her character. She works great with our next character in The Pvritan, her partner Neil Cavanaugh.</p>
<h3>Detective Neil Cavanaugh</h3>
<p>Neil is one of those characters you can’t help but love. He’s the complete opposite of Marti and it shows. He’s boisterous and great with people. But to be honest, he has his hands full with both his family and his partner. He’s a great character and the author was spot on to pair him with Marti.</p>
<h2>My Analysis</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. I loved the characters, the plot twists, and the vibe it gave off in general. However, I did think that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was no epilogue or anything to give us an idea of what might have happened after the big show down. This was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>One thing I have to say is that I really enjoyed the use of the Geneva Bible in the book. It was a refreshing thing as most books won’t incorporate anything like that. I love the original spellings of the words being used as well. While others might find it difficult to read, I had no issues.</p>
<p>I am also sincerely hoping that there will be more books with this pair of detectives. Marti and Neil work so well together and I’d love to see more books featuring them. Perhaps a second book that gives a clearer picture of what happened after the end of The Pvritan.</p>
<p>I gave this book four stars because it was a great book, however I felt there were a couple of things that could have been done better. If you’re a fan of murder mysteries with great twists and don’t mind a bit of gore, this book is for you.</p>

<p><b>“A heart-pounding page-turner with an outstanding cast of characters, a deliciously creepy setting, and an absolutely merciless body count.” –Courtney Summers, New York Times bestselling author of Sadie and The Project</b></p>
<p><b>A New York Times bestseller</b></p>
<p>It’s been almost a year since Makani Young came to live with her grandmother and she’s still adjusting to her new life in rural Nebraska. Then, one by one, students at her high school begin to die in a series of gruesome murders, each with increasing and grotesque flair.</p>
<p>As the body count rises and the terror grows closer, can Makani survive the killer’s twisted plan?</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been wanting to read There’s Someone Inside Your House since I first started hearing about it, before it came out. Back then, it was a book that had some hype to it – people were getting really cool packages for this book. I wasn’t lucky enough to receive one of the packages and eventually the book fell off my radar. But the other day it was on display as a slasher/horror book for Halloween at the library and I remembered how much I wanted to read it, so I snagged it. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Written by Stephanie Perkins, the same author of Anna and the French Kiss, this book definitely isn’t Anna and the French Kiss, or the rest of that trilogy either. This book is completely different. Those books were, as I recall, more contemporary romance type YA books. This is all thriller/horror. Trust me.</p>
<p>The writing was great. It was easy to read and the writing style helped keep my interest. The action starts from the very beginning, but in my opinion, the best thrillers do have action from the very beginning. I rarely like thrillers that start off slowly.</p>
<p>As for the characters, I love Makani. She’s fierce, loyal, and honestly, her secret just didn’t seem to be all that bad in the bigger scheme of things. Her idea that she might deserve to have the killer’s attention turned to her is just ludicrous in my opinion. I also loved Ollie. He was a great match for Makani and she brought him out of his shell a great deal. Plus, he made other friends in the process. Darby was great, though I cannot speak to the accuracy of the transgender representation, suffice it to say that I was glad to see there was transgender representation in this book. So many books I’ve read with LGBTQIA+ characters don’t cover trans characters. Alex was annoying but funny and I loved her character as well. We didn’t get as much of Darby and Alex as I might have liked, but the book wasn’t really about them.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the action started right away. But I think it was necessary to set the tone and mood for the book. This was someone who was gaslighting his/her victims. This killer was playing with his/her victims’ minds before killing them. This killer took their time. The sick, twisted cat-and-mouse game played the killer played with the victims is honestly terrifying. Imagine finding objects in places they don’t belong, objects just plain missing, and thinking that something might be wrong with you. That’s what this killer did to his/her victims before actually killing them.</p>
<p>The one thing that was never explained was the reasoning behind the way each body was mutilated and that kind of bothered me. Each body was mutilated in a different way but there was never an explanation given for the mutilation, only the explanation for why the killer did what he/she did. That’s one of the few complaints I had for this book was the lack of explanation.</p>
<p>I gave this book four stars on Goodreads because it truly is a great book. I’m hoping to see more thrillers from Stephanie Perkins because she does have a knack for it.</p>
