<p class="review__description"><b>Soon to be a major motion picture coming to Netflix in 2021!</b></p>
<p><b>“A heart-pounding page-turner with an outstanding cast of characters, a deliciously creepy setting, and an absolutely merciless body count.” –Courtney Summers, New York Times bestselling author of Sadie and The Project</b></p>
<p><b>A New York Times bestseller</b></p>
<p>It’s been almost a year since Makani Young came to live with her grandmother and she’s still adjusting to her new life in rural Nebraska. Then, one by one, students at her high school begin to die in a series of gruesome murders, each with increasing and grotesque flair.</p>
<p>As the body count rises and the terror grows closer, can Makani survive the killer’s twisted plan?</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been wanting to read There’s Someone Inside Your House since I first started hearing about it, before it came out. Back then, it was a book that had some hype to it – people were getting really cool packages for this book. I wasn’t lucky enough to receive one of the packages and eventually the book fell off my radar. But the other day it was on display as a slasher/horror book for Halloween at the library and I remembered how much I wanted to read it, so I snagged it. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Written by Stephanie Perkins, the same author of Anna and the French Kiss, this book definitely isn’t Anna and the French Kiss, or the rest of that trilogy either. This book is completely different. Those books were, as I recall, more contemporary romance type YA books. This is all thriller/horror. Trust me.</p>
<p>The writing was great. It was easy to read and the writing style helped keep my interest. The action starts from the very beginning, but in my opinion, the best thrillers do have action from the very beginning. I rarely like thrillers that start off slowly.</p>
<p>As for the characters, I love Makani. She’s fierce, loyal, and honestly, her secret just didn’t seem to be all that bad in the bigger scheme of things. Her idea that she might deserve to have the killer’s attention turned to her is just ludicrous in my opinion. I also loved Ollie. He was a great match for Makani and she brought him out of his shell a great deal. Plus, he made other friends in the process. Darby was great, though I cannot speak to the accuracy of the transgender representation, suffice it to say that I was glad to see there was transgender representation in this book. So many books I’ve read with LGBTQIA+ characters don’t cover trans characters. Alex was annoying but funny and I loved her character as well. We didn’t get as much of Darby and Alex as I might have liked, but the book wasn’t really about them.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the action started right away. But I think it was necessary to set the tone and mood for the book. This was someone who was gaslighting his/her victims. This killer was playing with his/her victims’ minds before killing them. This killer took their time. The sick, twisted cat-and-mouse game played the killer played with the victims is honestly terrifying. Imagine finding objects in places they don’t belong, objects just plain missing, and thinking that something might be wrong with you. That’s what this killer did to his/her victims before actually killing them.</p>
<p>The one thing that was never explained was the reasoning behind the way each body was mutilated and that kind of bothered me. Each body was mutilated in a different way but there was never an explanation given for the mutilation, only the explanation for why the killer did what he/she did. That’s one of the few complaints I had for this book was the lack of explanation.</p>
<p>I gave this book four stars on Goodreads because it truly is a great book. I’m hoping to see more thrillers from Stephanie Perkins because she does have a knack for it.</p>
