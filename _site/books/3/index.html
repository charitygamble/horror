<p class="review__description">A storm is raging. That’s merely one of Detective Daniel Nash’s troubles. Charlie Hamilton, the resident drunk and proprietor of Camp High Tide has mysteriously perished. After combing through old files, he learns that thirty years ago a young boy went missing. His body never discovered. He requests an interview with the five campers who were interrogated during that time.</p>
<p>The bodies of the suspects start piling up. Each death is similar and equally horrifying. Detective Nash must locate the suspects before the culprit has a chance to finish them off.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ll admit, this book seems awfully familiar. Probably because the beginning seems like a slightly revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>. And honestly, that’s what this book is. It’s a revamped version of <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, where the real culprits are the ones who get theirs instead of innocent kids who happened to be reopening the camp or near the lake.</p>
<p>Kids will be kids and bullies abound even at summer camp. Poor Timmy Waters suffers the same fate as Jason Voorhees, only Timmy dies as the result of a prank, not lifeguards and counselors not paying attention. But Timmy isn’t about to let his bullies get away with killing him. The tale is interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn’t be opposed to reading more of E. C. Fisher’s books if they’re all like <strong>The Rain</strong>.</p>
<p>Trust me, you won’t be disappointed with this book at all, if you like horror.</p>

<p class="review__description">Robert McCammon, Kevin Lucia, John R. Little, Lisa Morton, and Mark Allan Gunnells put the horror back in Halloween with a quintet of devilishly delightful tales, curated by acclaimed author and editor Brian James Freeman.</p>
<p><b>STRANGE CANDY by Robert McCammon</b> Chocolate bars and sour suckers are trick-or-treat staples, but beware the odd sweet at the bottom of your bag. You never know who it’s from—or what it might do to you.</p>
<p><b>THE RAGE OF ACHILLES by Kevin Lucia</b> Father Ward should have heeded the warnings about hearing confession on All Hallow’s Eve. Because a man is about to tell him a secret more haunting than any he has heard before. </p>
<p><b>DEMON AIR by John R. Little</b> Fear of flying is not uncommon. But on this transpacific airline, the real danger isn’t the flight itself. It’s whoever—or whatever—is up in the air with you.</p>
<p><b>LA HACIENDA DE LOS MUERTOS by Lisa Morton</b> Trick McGrew, former cowboy star of the silver screen, has never believed in tall tales. But down in Mexico, the land of La Llorona, he’s about to find out just how real urban legends can be.</p>
<p><b>#MAKEHALLOWEENSCARYAGAIN by Mark Allan Gunnells</b> Some people will go to any lengths to rack up retweets, likes, and follows on social media, no matter who they end up hurting . . . or even killing.</p>
<p><b>Praise for Halloween Carnival Volume 1</b></p>
<p>“<i>\\\[Halloween Carnival: Volume One]</i> provides festive entertainment from an assortment of the genre’s most accomplished regulars.”<b>—Unnerving Magazine</b></p>
<p> “Entertaining . . . I’d suggest reading them in the daytime.”<b>—Journey of a Bookseller</b> </p>
<p>“A solid collection . . . A Halloween fan who reads ebooks can’t go wrong here.”<b>—Battered, Tattered, Yellowed, & Creased</b></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday. This is something that anyone who knows me will tell you. I am a Halloween fanatic. So when given the chance to review books with stories based on Halloween and Halloween traditions – and those books are horror novels, you can bet I jumped at that chance. <em>Halloween Carnival Volume 1</em> is the first of five volumes of Halloween short stories, each in the horror category.</p>
<p>Volume 1 starts off with a story that isn’t so much scary as weird and sad. It’s a great story and one that I’ve read twice now – in fact I’ve read the entire book twice now – and I have to say that it’s just as weird and sad each time. The book ends with a story that I think belongs more in a mystery &amp; thriller compilation than a horror/Halloween compilation. Again, it’s great story and I’ve read it twice, but I just don’t think it fits so well with the idea of a Halloween/horror story.</p>
<p>The stories are all well written and I think they’d make a great addition to anyone’s Halloween reading list. It takes around 3 hours to finish the book if you read at an average to above average speed, so you could technically get through more than one of these volumes in a day.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 stars because the stories have a good Halloween creepy vibe to them and they work well for those wanting a quick Halloween-themed read.</p>

<p class="review__description">Horror Thriller Novels</p>
<p>This is a horror story of a man who began to see hallucinations, had so many battles to fight with, killing a king in his sleep, and a lady who was kidnapped by a man, who she doesn't know her plans, but she's not sure if she would make it out alive. If you are considering the shortest and most intriguing horror story, you found yourself one. This is the best story for you .with the right suspense.</p>
</section>
<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from BookSprout to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what the author was actually going for, because if he was truly going for a psychological thriller, he missed the mark. There was nothing thrilling or scary about this book. At all. There might have been some psychological things going on, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p><em>DE’FEAR</em> is a collection of two extremely short stories meant to set you on edge. While the second one did leave off on a fairly interesting cliffhanger, I have to say that neither story was particularly grabbing. The book was all of 24 pages on my iPhone’s iBooks, and the book hasn’t even been put on Goodreads as of this post being written.</p>
<p>I found the writing style to be juvenile, which I suppose is to be expected as it appears this is M. J. Reese’s first book and he is self-publishing. This means he is also self-editing which indicates that while he is trying, and I commend him for that, I believe he could benefit from some professional assistance with his writing.</p>
<p>The stories have potential, but sadly they read like the hurriedly jotted down ideas of a writer’s mind that whirls far too fast to keep up with. I believe if M. J. Reese were to sit down and work on just one of those ideas and make it an actual full length novel, he might be able to get his career going. As it is now, I am sad to say that a writer who just needs some guidance may never end up seeing the light of day.</p>
