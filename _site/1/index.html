<p class="review__description">IT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!</p>
<p>A frustrated Boston detective searches for the maniac responsible for mutilating a number of university coeds.</p></p>
</div>
<p>W﻿hen I looked into watching this one, the poster on Shudder said &quot;You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre&quot;. I thought that was kind of funny so I decided to give it a look. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the chainsaw massacre. It wasn't even really a massacre.</p>
<p>I﻿t kind of floors me that this movie was released after the original <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, yet it's so much different . It was almost as if the writers and the director were trying to cash in on the idea of <em>TCM</em>, but without having to go to all the trouble to make it actually be like <em>TCM</em>. Then they turn around and try to compare it to the classic.</p>
<p>T﻿he movie isn't terrible. It is a bit hokey, but we all know that most horror movies from that era aren't really scary and have terrible special effects - although they were &quot;cutting edge&quot; at the time. I will say that this one could have done a better job of keeping you guessing. You pretty much can guess who is doing all the killing once you you hear what one of the victims says to him.</p>
<p>A﻿ll in all, it isn't a bad movie and I'd watch it again.</p>

<p class="review__description">CAN A MOVIE GO TOO FAR?</p>
<p>A New York University professor returns from a rescue mission to the Amazon rainforest with the footage shot by a lost team of documentarians who were making a film about the area’s local cannibal tribes.</p></p>
</div>
<blockquote>Spoiler Alert - This review contains a few spoilers for the movie, although nothing that really spoils the plot. Read at your own risk.</blockquote>
<p>I﻿'m going to come right out and say, I hated this movie. I gave it two stars, which was being generous. It should probably have been a one star movie.</p>
<p>W﻿hen I watched <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i>, I thought &quot;how bad can it be&quot;? Bad. As in, really bad. As in, how did this movie ever even get made? Now when it comes to horror films, I'm used to blood, guts, gore, torture, and even cannibalism. This isn't the first movie I've seen where cannibalism plays a part in the film. So the gore, torture, and cannibalism didn't really bother me. What did?</p>
<p>G﻿raphic depictions of killing animals. I'm sorry, there's no reason to show in graphic detail the killing of an animal. I don't care if it is for food purposes or to show what kind of sick monster the killer is. Leave the animals out of it. I did not need to see the graphic murder of a muskrat or a giant turtle. I expect graphic depictions of killing people, after all that's half of what most horror films are about. But when you bring graphic depictions of animal killings into it, I draw the line.</p>
<p>I﻿ finished the movie simply because I wasn't about to leave it halfway through the movie, but I definitely won't be watching this one again. I have zero desire to ever see that kind of unnecessary animal cruelty ever again.</p>

<p class="review__description">BEYOND DEATH… BEYOND EVIL… BEYOND THE DREADED GATES OF HELL.</p>
<p>A young woman inherits an old hotel in Louisiana where, following a series of supernatural “accidents”, she learns that the building was built over one of the entrances to Hell.</p>
</section>
<p>When I watched <i>The Beyond</i> on Shudder, I knew it was going to be a bit on the &quot;hokey&quot; side of things. After all, the movie was released in 1981. Special effects weren't as good back then, so I wasn't expecting to see gore on today's scale.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that censors in 1983 basically cut the film to almost nothing and that it took nearly 20 years and help from Quentin Tarantino to get the uncut version released in the US. Apparently today's standards of fright and gore would be far too much for 1983's sensibilities, as I'll be honest, the gore wasn't that bad at all and I didn't see too much in the way of &quot;scary&quot; things. Then again, I don't scare easily when it comes to movies and books.</p>
<p>T﻿he plot is interesting enough although I wouldn't say it is the most interesting movie I've ever watched. It kept me interested and entertained for the roughly hour-and-a-half that the movie ran for, which is all I asked for in the scheme of things.</p>
<p>I﻿ gave the movie three stars, which means I'd watch it again, although it wouldn't be my first choice.</p>
