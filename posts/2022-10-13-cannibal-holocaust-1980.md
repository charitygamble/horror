Spoiler Alert - This review contains a few spoilers for the movie, although nothing that really spoils the plot. Read at your own risk.

I﻿'m going to come right out and say, I hated this movie. I gave it two stars, which was being generous. It should probably have been a one star movie.

W﻿hen I watched <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i>, I thought "how bad can it be"? Bad. As in, really bad. As in, how did this movie ever even get made? Now when it comes to horror films, I'm used to blood, guts, gore, torture, and even cannibalism. This isn't the first movie I've seen where cannibalism plays a part in the film. So the gore, torture, and cannibalism didn't really bother me. What did? 

G﻿raphic depictions of killing animals. I'm sorry, there's no reason to show in graphic detail the killing of an animal. I don't care if it is for food purposes or to show what kind of sick monster the killer is. Leave the animals out of it. I did not need to see the graphic murder of a muskrat or a giant turtle. I expect graphic depictions of killing people, after all that's half of what most horror films are about. But when you bring graphic depictions of animal killings into it, I draw the line.

I﻿ finished the movie simply because I wasn't about to leave it halfway through the movie, but I definitely won't be watching this one again. I have zero desire to ever see that kind of unnecessary animal cruelty ever again.
