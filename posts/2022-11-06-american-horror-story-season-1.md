I'm going to be perfectly honest - I didn't expect to care much for *American Horror Story* at first. Horror television typically doesn't catch my interest due to the nature of television. It's short-form, tons of commercials, and frankly, you just get better horror out of movies than television.

When it comes to Season 1 of *American Horror Story*, I wasn't entirely wrong. I'm going to say this now - I didn't care for the season. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not my favorite. Titled *Murder House*, the first season of this anthology series honestly wasn't that scary or horror-like. In fact, I found it quite boring to be honest. 

I did enjoy the idea of whoever dies on the grounds of the house stays there, but that's about all I enjoyed. The characters were "blah" to me - I didn't particularly enjoy any of them and thought they could have had better personalities. I think Jessica Lange's character, Constance Langdon, was the most interesting character of the bunch. 

Like I said, the season wasn't horrible so I gave the season 3 stars. As you'll see in further reviews for other seasons, I find that some seasons are much better than others.
