W﻿hen I looked into watching this one, the poster on Shudder said "You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre". I thought that was kind of funny so I decided to give it a look. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the chainsaw massacre. It wasn't even really a massacre.

I﻿t kind of floors me that this movie was released after the original *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, yet it's so much different . It was almost as if the writers and the director were trying to cash in on the idea of *TCM*, but without having to go to all the trouble to make it actually be like *TCM*. Then they turn around and try to compare it to the classic.

T﻿he movie isn't terrible. It is a bit hokey, but we all know that most horror movies from that era aren't really scary and have terrible special effects - although they were "cutting edge" at the time. I will say that this one could have done a better job of keeping you guessing. You pretty much can guess who is doing all the killing once you you hear what one of the victims says to him.

A﻿ll in all, it isn't a bad movie and I'd watch it again.
