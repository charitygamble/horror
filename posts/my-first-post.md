Welcome to The Horror Revue - a blog where I review horror books, movies, and TV shows. I've always been a fan of horror movies, books, and TV shows. I remember watching "Tales from the Dark Side" late at night on Saturday nights with my sister and her friend. To me, they weren't particularly scary but they could be unsettling. Another show we liked to watch was Friday the 13th - the series. If you know, you know.

Fast forward a few years, and I was watching horror flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween with my friends. All through my teen years, my mom would buy me horror novels while she bought herself romance novels at our local used bookstore. So my love of horror has been with me for a long time. 

So now that you know a little background... welcome to the circus!
